Default installation of Jenkins is straight forward and is outlined by the following steps;

* From [https://jenkins.io/download/] select the windows Long Term Support (LTS) to download. At the time of writing this wiki that latest LTS version is 2.73.2.
* Unzip the downloaded *jenkins-2.73.2.zip*
* Select the *jenkins.msi* installer to start installation. Select all default options when presented during installation.
* When presented with the screen shown below, choose the default highlighted option to *Install Suggested Plugins*. (Later we will install other plug-ins.)

* Next you will be presented with the screen shown below, *Create First Admin User*. Usually this is the person who is performing the installation. And so I have already setup myself as the first user / ADMIN. (More details on users will be provided later)
