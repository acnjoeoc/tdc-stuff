There are numerous ways to execute a test using Stormtest as outlined below;
* 1) Execute under Stormtest Daemon
* 2) Execute locally on Stormtest server from command
* 3) Execute remotely from Stormtest remote client from command line
* 4) Execute locally on Stormtest server from command line via Jenkins

All options are valid and are usefull during different stages of test script
development. This wiki will concern itself with the last option i.e. executing
test scripts via Jenkins which will run tests locally on the Stormtest server.
